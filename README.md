# BasicCNNs

An AI project which involved programming various CNN architectures from scratch using Python/PyTorch with assistance from Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda

Architectures implemented in this project were limited by hardware so they did not have many parameters:
  LeNet-5
  JecNet-5
  AlexNet/ImageNet
  
Each model was trained on Google Collab and many results were derived from them such as training execution time and training loss given various epochs, learning rate and optimisers. In my conclusion, I found that my architecture, JecNet-5 had the best performance on the CIFAR-10 Dataset despite having less parameters and layers than AlexNet/ImageNet. The graph to my architecture is found below:
